High Performance Application Proxy.

The 4th iteration of my application proxy,
designed to allow me to just write code and not worry about anything else.

The only tweak required in applications is to use the provided socket,
after that its all as normal.

Logs are gathered and stored, admin panel is a WIP, mostly non-functional as of now.

Security is a core tenet of the system, and access can be restricted on a per application basis.
